            Gary and Kerry Stanton, founders of the UHBH, have been interested in supporting vulnerable children, especially babies,for many years.

            Gary is a chartered accountant (qualified UK and SA) and worked at 
            Deloitte for 13 years. He then headed up an electronics company 
            for 11 years. Kerry is a business owner with a master of science 
            degree specialising in environmental work. She is the MD of KSEMS 
            Environmental Consulting, which has operated for 20 years. They 
            have three children, Sam, Becky and Sma.

            They began working with the 1000 Hills Community Centre 10 years
                ago and helped young, school going moms by taking care of babies
                whilst they were studying. The family became more and more
                involved with a little baby girl who was not thriving in an
                unsafe environment. Eventually this baby girl was adopted into
                the Stanton Family and she is now a bright active 10 year old,
                who excels at sports and has many, many, friends. Simangele and
                her older brother and sister are very involved in the UHBH and
                are all competent baby caregivers.

            Although the family focused their time and energies on settling
                Simangele for the next decade – their desire to help more
                vulnerable babies never strayed far from their minds or hearts.

            The family started working actively again with vulnerable babies
                at the beginning of 2018 when they became aware of the crisis of
                abandoned babies in South Africa and babies requiring foster
                care whilst they are awaiting adoption. The government
                facilities for these purposes are very poorly resourced and
                over-subscribed. The family became increasingly involved in
                another baby home and had looked after at least 14 babies during
                the year for various periods of time before finalising the
                decision to open the UHBH this year. There is no other baby home
                in the area and there are many vulnerable babies being deserted
                in environments not conducive to their health or wellbeing.
